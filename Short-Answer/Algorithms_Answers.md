## Exercise I

a) The run time of this snippet would be O(n) (linear).  One operation needs to be done, and the time will increase as n increases or decreases.


b) The run time of this snippet would be O(n^3) (linearithmic). Three operations need to be done and as the size of the input increases, the runtime wil grow at a slightly faster rate.  The nested loop makes this solution less scalable.


c) The run time of this snippet would be O(n) (linear).  The time will increase as the size of the input/bunnies increases or decreases.
